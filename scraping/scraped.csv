"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side.

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."

In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"A pair of Staten Island lawyers offered Tuesday to represent any Big Apple firefighter for free if they get jammed up for booing state Attorney General Letitia James at last week’s raucous promotion ceremony. Lawyers Mark Fonte and Louis Gelormino said the firefighters had the right to voice their support for Donald Trump and to lambast James, who has been prosecuting him — as FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanaugh   the jeering Bravest. “If you are being ‘hunted down’ by FDNY brass for exercising your freedom of speech contact our office at once,” the men’s firm, F&G Legal Group, wrote in a letter to the Fire Department’s rank-and-file. “We always answer the call. We stand ready to assist New York’s Bravest,” the letter said.  The firm has already sued the city over its COVID mandates and the location of some migrant shelters.  This time, they are rushing to the defense of firefighters after a cluster of smoke-eaters  during Thursday’s ceremony at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.  The disgruntled group voiced support for former President Trump, who was hit with a $454 million judgment last month in a civil suit filed by James’ office.  “If they have a right to applaud, they have a right to boo or express their displeasure,” Fonte told The Post on Tuesday.  “If you invite a controversial figure to speak, you have to expect pushback,” he said. “The people at fault are the FDNY brass who are greatly out of touch with their workers.” Kavanagh deployed the department’s Bureau of Investigations and Trials to track down the offenders by combing through video footage of the event and has said firefighters who crossed the line could face discipline, although she has not specified what that could be.  The controversy heated up further when Kavanagh returned to the church Sunday and apologized for the conduct of several firefighters during the event, calling their actions “unprofessional.” Some Bravest who later spoke to The Post   while defending the anti-James boos.  detailed the department’s objection to the boos and cautioned members of the fire service to keep their political views to themselves while on duty.  “When you’re not on duty, feel however you want about politicians,” said a memo distributed at Big Apple firehouses Sunday. “Vote. Protest. That’s your right. But don’t do it on the job’s time, on other members’ time, or on their families’ time. Do it on your own time.” Officials at the Uniformed Firefighters Association, the union representing the rank and file, said in a statement that the smoke-eaters’ rowdy response to James as “disappointing.” But union President Andrew Ansbro also urged any firefighter who gets into hot water over the incident to keep their mouths shut and reach out so the union can rep them. “We will strongly defend any of our members who face discipline,” Ansbro wrote.  In a statement Tuesday, FDNY officials maintained that there has been no “investigation” into the members who booed at the event.  “FDNY leadership is having ongoing conversations with our members about decorum during department events to ensure we are upholding the core values that make the FDNY the greatest fire department in the world,” the statement said.  “Being a NYC firefighter is an honor and we will continue to impress upon our members that their actions impact everyone who wears the uniform.” On Saturday, department spokesman Jim Long defended the FDNY’s stance, saying that it had nothing to do with politics but was rather about “professionalism at an official event. “Nobody is hunting anyone down,” Long said. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "

The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side.

Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."

"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home!

But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  .

"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "

Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

(He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."

Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."

Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep.

If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X.

"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"

Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side.

Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

					Never miss a story.				 Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  .

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out.

In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."

"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.

(A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X.

Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home!

But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home!

(A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.

"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

					Never miss a story.				 Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."

He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

					Never miss a story.				 Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home!

(A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov.

"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  .

Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "

He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."

Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  .

Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables.

"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg.

"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

(He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

					Never miss a story.				 Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov.

"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."

Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg.

"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  .

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."

But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."

Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."

(A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."

I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X.

Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home!

A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump.

"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump.

Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday.

"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov.

"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  .

He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

					Never miss a story.				 Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."

Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

(He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."

Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."

A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."

A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."

Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.

He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

Hooked on Housewives?				 “The unfortunate part is that [Donald] could have taken a moment to embrace him and pose for the camera, which would have been a significant PR move,” one person said via X in response to the clip.  “Instead, his actions reflect those of a self-centered individual, solely focused on his own interests.” Another simply weighed in, writing, “Damn, that was cold.” Donald’s interactions with his family members appear to be under scrutiny as he inches closer to clinching the Republican presidential nomination for the 2024 election. The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side.

Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

					Never miss a story.				 Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."

" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020. Guilfoyle asked guests to donate to the charity Furry Friends of Jupiter. She was previously married twice, to onetime San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as furniture heir Eric Villency.  Don Jr. was formerly wed to  ."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"

Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X.

"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"

He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side.

Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home!

But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight.

"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"

Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.

There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

Hooked on Housewives?				 “The unfortunate part is that [Donald] could have taken a moment to embrace him and pose for the camera, which would have been a significant PR move,” one person said via X in response to the clip.  “Instead, his actions reflect those of a self-centered individual, solely focused on his own interests.” Another simply weighed in, writing, “Damn, that was cold.” Donald’s interactions with his family members appear to be under scrutiny as he inches closer to clinching the Republican presidential nomination for the 2024 election. The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China.

"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.

"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement.

"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"It’s a Merry Trumpmas year round at Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Florida home! Guilfoyle celebrated her 55th birthday over the weekend with an over-the-top party that featured acrobats and a singer, we hear.  But the most surprising detail of the bash was that the duo had a Christmas tree still up in front of a large portrait of  . (A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024. In Trump We Trust.” The area dedicated to Don Jr.’s dad was just one piece of eye candy at the “Casino Royale”-themed birthday, which was attended by   and her husband, Michael Boulos, as well as Eric and Lara Trump. Guests were met by a greeter in a Mad Hatter-meets-”Hunger Games” gold foil hat and silvery tiered ball gown.  Aerialists performed in front of feather-clad acrobats.  A source further told us there were also poker tables. There were also several birthday cakes including one with an image of Guilfoyle in a red dress, plus a gold and white cake in the shape of the letter K.  The couple got engaged in 2020.

"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to Russian statehood, sovereignty or independence, but said he hoped that the US would refrain from actions that could trigger a nuclear conflict. Putin’s statement was another blunt warning to the West ahead of   in which he’s all but certain to win another six-year term. In an interview with Russian state television released early Wednesday,   as a veteran politician who fully understands possible dangers of escalation, and said that he doesn’t think that the world is heading to a nuclear war. At the same time, he said that Russia’s nuclear forces are in full readiness and “from the military-technical viewpoint, we’re prepared.” Putin said that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” The Russian leader has repeatedly talked about his readiness to use nuclear weapons   in February 2022. The most recent such threat came in his  when he warned the West that deepening its involvement in the fighting in Ukraine would risk a nuclear war. Asked in the interview if he has ever considered using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin responded that there has been no need for that. He also voiced confidence that Moscow will achieve its goals in Ukraine and held the door open for talks, emphasizing that any deal would require firm guarantees from the West. Putin said that a recent spike in Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside Russia is part of efforts to derail the country’s three-day presidential election, which starts Friday and which he is all but certain to win. Russian authorities reported another major attack by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday. One of the drones hit an oil refinery in the Ryazan region, injuring at least two people and sparking a fire. Another drone was downed as it was approaching a refinery near St. Petersburg and 30 others were downed in the southwestern Voronezh region."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"

(A source told us this Tannenbaum is permanent — and they call it a Patriot Tree!) Either way, eyebrows were raised over the ornate, star-spangled conifer. A pic seen by Page Six showed the tree decorated in red, white and blue — with ornaments that said, “Let’s Go Brandon” and “Trump 2024.”  There were even little hats that said “Make America Great Again.” We have not been able to independently verify that Patriots Trees are a thing, though there are a large number of landscaping and tree service companies of the same name, including at least one run by veterans. Maybe World of Interiors should be alerted? The couple’s actual Christmas tree has been removed, we are told. Next to the couple’s Patriot Tree, to complete the MAGA decor, is a large street art-style portrait of former President Trump pointing Uncle Sam-like against an American flag background that says, “Trump 2024.

"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps.

"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"Republican South Dakota   is cutting her teeth on the infomercial circuit with a new testimonial for a cosmetic dentistry firm in Texas, which left some on social media stunned.  “Well, hi. I’m Kristi Noem. I’m the governor of South Dakota and had the opportunity to come to Smile Texas to fix my teeth, which has been absolutely amazing,” the 52-year-old governor says in the   posted on her X account late Monday night. Noem, 52, explained that “years ago” a biking accident left her needing a tooth adjustment. Rather than having the procedure done locally, Noem opted to fly more than 1,000 miles from the South Dakota governor’s mansion, to Sugar Land, Texas, to get the two procedures needed to fix her smile. “They have been absolutely phenomenal,” the governor said of the dentists at Smile Texas.  Noem noted in the polished testimonial – complete with before and after photos and several close-ups of her new chompers – that in the world of politics, “everything is speaking and interviews and giving speeches” and she wanted people to “look at me to hear the words that I say and not be distracted by something that I’m wearing or how I look.”  It’s unclear if Noem was paid for her testimonial, which was also posted to her Instagram account.  Under the platform’s rules, it would be required for her to disclose any paid partnership she has with the company.  Noem’s office and Smile Texas did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.  “This is an extremely bizarre thing for a governor to post,” conservative commentator Nate Hochman posted on X after viewing the governor’s spot.  “Who told you this was a good idea?” Joshua Reed Eakle, the marketing director for libertarian non-profit Students For Liberty tweeted.  “At the South Dakota Dental Association, a day of fire and fury,” journalist Christopher Ingraham quipped on X. Former President Donald Trump revealed earlier this year that Noem is   for potential running mates in the general election. "
"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Republican nomination for president, eclipsing the 1,215 delegate threshold after wins in the Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state primaries.  The ex-commander in chief is also expected to win Hawaii’s GOP caucus, which was held Tuesday. Trump, 77, dominated the GOP primaries and caucuses, losing only one state – Vermont – and the District of Columbia to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who   following her disappointing Super Tuesday performance last week.  He kicked off the 2024 presidential primary and caucus cycle with eight straight victories between Jan. 15 and March 2.  Trump trounced the GOP field without ever stepping foot on a debate stage, refusing to participate in any of the five Republican National Committee sanctioned forums this cycle because of the double-digit polling advantage, which he held over his primary opponents since his Nov. 15, 2022, campaign launch.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as the most viable Republican alternative to the 45th president, came within 13 percentage points of matching Trump’s national support in the polls in late February 2023 but   around the former president after he was hit with the first of four criminal indictments.  The presumptive GOP nominee now enters the general election phase of his presidential campaign facing 91 felony counts — but with the support of nearly 80% of Republican voters.  With his first criminal trial slated to start in Manhattan on March 25, where he faces 34 charges related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump will likely be forced to juggle his general election campaign schedule along with courtroom appearances.  Trump also has impending state and federal trials in Georgia and Washington, DC, related to allegations that he interfered in the 2020 presidential election, and another federal trial in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency. Trump, hoping to become the first former commander in chief since Grover Cleveland to win a second non-consecutive White House term, stands to face President Biden in November.  The 2020 general election rematch will be the first since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson in a replay of the 1952 presidential contest.  A recent survey from the   found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden –  48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core of supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Several surveys also show Trump defeating Biden in a number key battleground states. Trump is besting Biden among registered voters in Arizona (49%-43%), Michigan (46%-44%), Nevada (48%-42%), North Carolina (50%-41%), Pennsylvania (49%-43%) and Wisconsin (46%-42%), according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released late last month.  The latest  , which Biden won in 2020, shows Trump with an edge over the incumbent as well. Trump leads Biden 46% to 42% in the Peach State, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from   released Tuesday. Biden, 81, has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, amid concerns over the economy, border security and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur  not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden reached the 1,968 delegate threshold needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president on Tuesday as well, with wins in the Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Northern Mariana Islands Democratic primaries.  The incumbent embarrassingly lost the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday – Biden’s only defeat this cycle – to previously unknown candidate Jason Palmer. "
"Most congressional hearings shed far more heat than light, but the testimony of special counsel   was a welcome exception.  Yes, there was plenty of heat, but in the end, viewers witnessed a clear demonstration of how partisanship has corrupted the Department of Justice.  They also saw that Democrats are not troubled by that rank favoritism as long as their guy gets a free pass and the other guy gets nailed.  There are many causes for the deep polarization gripping America, but one of the most important is the contrasting ways   and   have been treated for their alleged mishandling of classified documents.  Trump faces a 40-count federal indictment, while Biden gets off scot-free despite a finding that he improperly kept and used such documents for 40 years.  On its face, the disparate treatment smacks of a double standard, especially because no former president had ever been indicted for anything after leaving office.  That history created a formidable barrier, but  , the prober assigned to Trump, was bulldog-aggressive and treated him like a common criminal, complete with a surprise FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.  On the other hand, Hur, assigned to Biden’s case, was far more restrained and respectful of whom he was dealing with.  His team found lots of evidence of wrongdoing, but after interviewing Biden, decided not to charge him, insisting a jury probably would not convict because of his age and memory lapses.  Or, as Hur’s report famously put it, Biden would be seen as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”  Hur, in his testimony, resisted Dem attempts to say he “exonerated” Biden, saying flatly: “We did not exonerate him.”  He also acknowledged that Biden used classified documents and even shared them with a ghostwriter for a book that earned him $8 million.  As GOP firebrand Jim Jordan put it, “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules.”  Although it’s possible there are reasonable explanations for such divergent treatment of the two men, including allegations that Trump urged his lawyer and others to lie about documents he retained, the parsing of statutes and circumstances has failed to dispel the smell that something is terribly rotten.  Ours is an era of rapidly declining trust in government, with polls showing that as many as two-thirds of Americans have lost trust in the Department of Justice and the FBI.  It doesn’t help that the agency and the FBI, during the Obama-Biden administration, improperly spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign.  That shameful history still weighs heavily on the department’s credibility, especially with Biden’s attorney general,  , running the store.  He is the one who appointed both Smith and Hur and decided which man would probe which president.  Given the partisan pattern under Garland, it is hard to believe he made his choices without thinking ahead to likely outcomes.  Smith is a noted head-hunter and has had big convictions overturned on appeal.  The investigative phase of his case was full of FBI leaks about what Trump allegedly did and he is pushing to put the former president on trial before the election.  If that’s not election interference, what is it?  And yet by his silence, Garland effectively greenlights the outrageous push.  Hur, on the other hand, gives every indication of taking a thoughtful and careful by-the-books approach. Despite the fact that Dems tried to tar him with the fact that he is a registered Republican, as if that’s illegal, there was not a single leak from his probe of Biden.  Against that backdrop, it’s reasonable to believe the contradictory results were baked into the cake from the get-go.  That suspicion compounds an undeniable fact that Garland’s tenure has been marked by extreme partisanship, ranging from siccing FBI agents on complaining parents at school-board meetings to his clear reluctance to prosecute  .  Garland sat on the president’s son’s case for years and his office was ready to let him walk until a federal judge exposed a concealed sweetheart deal that included an unheard-of pledge of immunity.  The inclusion of the pledge itself should have been a crime.  Out of embarrassment, and with whistleblowers pointing out how the probe into the family was hampered by Biden appointees at several junctures, Garland’s team suddenly decided that prosecution of the son was warranted after all.  Yet to this day, it has done nothing to follow the millions upon millions of dollars that flowed into the Biden family accounts from foreign sources.  We know the family got more than $20 million, that various family members got a cut and that brother Jim Biden wrote checks of $240,000 to Joe Biden, only because House GOP leaders did what Garland refused — they followed the money.  In what can be construed as a menacing response to those findings, the FBI recently arrested one of its own informants, claiming Alexander Smirnov lied when he said Hunter and Joe each got bribes of $5 million from a Ukrainian energy company owner.  The move gave the White House and its media mouthpieces ammunition to declare the GOP move to impeach Joe Biden DOA.  Note that the FBI never arrested Christopher Steele, also an informant and the author of the phony dossier commissioned by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia.  Apparently, not all informants are treated equally.  Nor did the FBI ever charge Clinton for keeping thousands of classified documents on a private, personal server, so not all presidential candidates are treated equally.  As for Garland, it is an undisputed fact that Biden made it known to him that he wanted Trump prosecuted over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  So much for the president’s vow to not interfere in criminal cases.  Before long, that case was also assigned to Smith, and Trump faces a slew of indictments there, too.  Meanwhile, other criminal cases have been brought against Trump in Georgia and New York.  There is compelling evidence the Georgia prosecutors, who have ethical and legal problems of their own, coordinated with the White House.  Then there’s an unwarranted, spiteful civil case in New York that has the potential to bankrupt Trump’s real-estate business.  All these cases have obvious flaws and all were brought by Democratic prosecutors, creating an inescapable impression that this is a coordinated effort to destroy Biden’s political opponent.

					Never miss a story.				 It’s the stuff of banana republics, but that hasn’t stopped Dems from declaring that Trump is the one who is a threat to democracy.  What they lack in facts they more than make up for with chutzpah.  Tuesday’s hearing produced no evidence or claims that dispelled suspicions about the clashing classified document cases.  If anything, the questions, answers and statements added support to the belief that different standards are what produced different outcomes.  Consider, for example, that just as the hearing began, Garland’s office suddenly released the transcript of Hur’s interviews with Biden.  Republicans complained about the timing, wondering why Justice waited until the last minute.  The interviews took place in October and Hur’s report was released a month ago.  Democrats notably didn’t complain.  The only sensible conclusion about the in-your-face timing is that Garland’s team feels so immune it doesn’t even try to hide its bias anymore.  Most likely, the transcript was withheld because some portions make Biden look bad.  Delaying the release made it harder for Republicans to read it in time to question Hur about the contents.  On top of all the other injustices taking place under Biden and Garland, this one’s a small matter.  But a reminder that they have no shame or fear."
"Special counsel   was in the hot seat for four hours Tuesday as President Biden’s congressional allies sought to destroy him for doubting Biden’s intellect. They had no case. Instead, they turned the event into Three Stooges-caliber theater. Hur’s report last month concluded that Biden had “  and disclosed classified materials” — violations of federal law. But Hur said that prosecuting him would be dicey because jurors could view Biden as an “elderly man with poor memory.” The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Hur’s report was only about “Republicans trying to re-elect the former white supremacist-in-chief,” according to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), referring to former President Donald Trump. Fixating on Biden’s document shenanigans could aid Trump and cause the worldwide triumph of tyranny, wailed Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) derided Hur as a Republican bootlicker hoping to get a prize appointment if Trump is re-elected. One Democrat after another put Hur into a headlock and jammed words into his mouth. When Hur objected to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) claiming his report exonerated Biden, she cut him off: “Mr. Hur, it is my time.”   Democrats, veering toward full “The Manchurian Candidate,” seemed ready to recite with glazed eyes: “Joe Biden is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.”  Biden needs plenty of sycophants because of his hypocrisy, legal violations and brazen falsehoods. After the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to seize classified documents in August 2022, Biden said he was stunned that “anyone could be that irresponsible.” After Hur’s report came out, Biden declared: “I did not share classified information.”  Biden claimed that all the classified stuff “in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.”  But Hur testified that those claims were “inconsistent with our findings.” Biden’s classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, in Biden’s Delaware garage, his basement den and third-floor den, his main-floor office, the University of Delaware and at the Biden Institute, some in open boxes. The 40 felony charges that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump for classified-document violations were perpetually showcased by Democratic members. But no one explained how Trump’s alleged offenses after January 2021 retroactively exonerated Biden’s violations stretching back to the 1970s. Republicans had fair points. They wondered at what point in his life Biden became too clueless to be responsible for violating federal law. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained that Biden knew the rules on classified information “but broke them because he was writing a book” and pocketing an $8 million advance.

					Never miss a story.				 “Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules!” Jordan exclaimed. Hur’s report stated that Biden also wrongfully retained classified documents to “buttress his legacy as a world leader” in his ghostwritten book.   Some Republicans were confounded that the special counsel chose not to recommend criminal charges.  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) groused that Hur chose to “apply this ‘senile cooperator’ theory that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you’d get a conviction.” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) was perturbed that Hur let the president off the hook by claiming Biden didn’t recognize that a “confidential” marking meant a document was classified — even though Biden stated that he knew that during the interview. (Déjà vu: The FBI let Hillary Clinton off the same hook in 2016 when she claimed she thought   on government documents referred to alphabetical order, not classification status.) Biden had falsely accused Hur of raising the issue of the death of Beau Biden, but, as the transcript makes clear, it was the president who repeatedly mentioned it — and he was indeed unaware of the year his son died. The president’s attention wandered during the questioning, including when he started to make childlike noises like his beloved old Corvette.  No wonder the White House intervened to seek to censor the report’s comment on Biden’s mental capacity.   Biden had at least one shining moment of candor and competence during the Hur interview: “We over-classify everything. … And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.”  Both Biden and Trump — along with Clinton, Mike Pence and busloads of other politicians as yet unnamed — have been caught in a bureaucratic tar pit created to enable Washington to blindfold Americans.  The best-case outcome of both the Biden and Trump classification controversies would be a radical rollback of pointless federal secrecy."
"Joe Biden doesn’t have a problem with illegal immigrants.  He’s made that clear in his shame-faced retreat from his impromptu  He regrets using the offending word, doesn’t want to disrespect illegal immigrants and believes that they are absolutely essential to the success of the United States.  “Look, they built the country,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. He added that they are “the reason our economy is growing.” Yes, where would America be without the essential contribution made to its economic vigor by desperate people crossing the border in violation of our laws?  This is all very revealing. Biden certainly sounds more like a president who has had a largely open border rather than one who, as he’s been insisting lately,  if only Republicans will pass the legislation he wants. Why, if Biden’s correct, would we deny ourselves the benefits of illegal labor?  It’s true that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly work once they get here; it’s why they come in the first place, after all. But the idea that a fraction of all immigrants, whose numbers have only drastically increased the past couple of decades, “built the country” is a ridiculous fabrication and a profound insult to American workers, past and present. Prior to today, the highest percentage of all the foreign-born in the US population was 14.8%, around the turn of the 20th century. Roughly one out of seven people obviously weren’t responsible for the construction of America. As for illegal immigrants specifically, they didn’t constitute the majority of any job category in America as of 2018. Even construction workers — involved in the literal building of the country’s physical plant — were 65% native-born.  Biden is exaggerating, too, when he suggests the economy is growing only because of illegal immigrants. But it is true that legal and illegal immigrants have made an outsized contribution to recent economic growth. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren’t flawless but capture the big picture, the total number of employed people in the United States increased by 2.3 million between February 2020 and February 2024.

					Never miss a story.				 Over those four years, the foreign-born employment level increased by 3.3 million, whereas the level of native-born employment is still down by a million. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that roughly half of those immigrant jobs are going to illegal immigrants. Needless to say, this isn’t the political bragging point that Biden might think.  “Bidenomics — it’s been great for immigrants regardless of legal status” is not a slogan the president should want to use in a campaign against Donald Trump. To attribute our economic growth to immigrants is to ignore the contributions of the 85% of the country that is native-born, and all its work, investment and spending.  The deeper problem is how the surge in immigrant labor coincides with a decline labor-force participation among low-skilled Americans  A report by Camarota notes that the labor-force participation rate of native-born men without a bachelor’s degree is 75.6%, still lower than the pre-pandemic level of 76.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and lower than in 2006 (80.5%) and 2000 (82.6%). Constantly adding less-skilled immigrant workers to the labor force may increase overall GDP, but it doesn’t make the United States wealthier on a per capita basis, the more important metric. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, greater levels of immigration will increase GDP “by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise.” On the other hand, real GDP   “would be 0.8 percent smaller.” Biden gives no indication that he sees such trade-offs. Who’d want fewer of the migrants “building our country” when we can have ever more?"
"Special counsel   spent 15 months investigating now-President Biden’s unlawful retention of classified documents from his years in the Senate and as vice president and concluded that though Biden “willfully” kept the docs (some for decades), he shouldn’t be prosecuted because a jury was unlikely to convict a guy who comes off as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats spent much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary hearing with Hur pushing him to call this an “exoneration” of the prez. Oh, and bashing him for honestly saying how Biden came off in their interviews. Plus reminding everyone:   of New York outright stated Hur’s report “represents the complete and total exoneration” of Biden (it doesn’t) and made it “clear that he didn’t lie” (it didn’t).  of Maryland raged about former President Donald Trump and how “the tyrants and dictators of the world are on the march” — seriously.  of Tennessee complained about Republicans talking about Biden’s mental state: “That’s disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.”  of Georgia insisted Hur is a member of the Federalist Society (he isn’t) who used “your report to trash and smear President Biden.” “You did disparage the president,” whined   of California.  of California wanted him to promise not to take a Trump administration job.  of Washington state wasted most of her time pushing for Hur to say “exoneration.”  of Missouri took it back to “former white supremacist-in-chief, Donald Trump.” Look: Hur is a straight shooter straight out of central casting.

					Never miss a story.				 He gave Biden a way out of any future prosecution, though he made it clear the evidence could warrant a recommendation to prosecute.  (He clearly doubted it would serve the public interest to further demean the presidency; the “jury won’t convict” gambit also preserved some shred of respect for the office.)  But rather than be grateful for avoiding a high-profile embarrassment in an election year, Democrats couldn’t stop themselves from venting righteous indignation — which only succeeded in hurting the president’s image further.  Hur took great care to say in his report everything he was going to say; all the Dems’ badgering did was force him to repeat himself — which only spelled out the worst for Biden. That is: Biden knew perfectly well what the law is on classified docs; it didn’t stop him from taking stuff home back in his Senate days (when he had zero right), nor from knowingly holding on to more docs after he left office as veep: He’s even on tape in 2017 admitting he had classified stuff. And Hur never said Biden is senile. No: He flagged how confused-  the prez got under the prosecutor’s questioning — indeed, the transcript proves Biden is the one who suddenly brings up son Beau’s death when the conversation gets specific, getting upset in what a cynic might see as an excuse for changing the subject. Since Biden couldn’t be put on trial for any classified-doc crimes until after leaving the Oval Office, Hur plainly expects he’d play the same game on the stand, and get away with it. Yes, the president has memory issues (he shows it all the time), but the reason Hur let him off the hook is that Biden’s a clever scoundrel. The Democrats were just lucky Tuesday they didn’t accidentally corner him into saying so outright."
"US lawmakers are threatening to ban TikTok but also say they are giving its Chinese parent company a chance to keep it running. The premise of a bipartisan bill headed for a vote in the US House of Representatives is that TikTok fans in the US can keep scrolling through their favorite social media app so long as Beijing-based ByteDance gives up on owning it. “It doesn’t have to be this painful for ByteDance,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and bill co-sponsor, recently posted on X. “They could make it a lot easier on themselves by simply divesting @tiktok_us. It’s their choice.” But it’s not going to be as simple as lawmakers are making it sound, according to experts. While some people have voiced an interest in buying TikTok’s US business — among them “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary — there are a number of challenges including a 6-month deadline to get it done. “Somebody would have to actually be ready to shell out the large amount of money that this product and system is worth,” said Stanford University researcher Graham Webster, who studies Chinese technology policy and US-China relations. “But even if somebody has deep enough pockets and is ready to go into negotiating to purchase, this sort of matchmaking on acquisitions is not quick.” Big tech companies could afford it but would likely face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and China.  Then again, if the bill actually becomes law and survives First Amendment court challenges, it could make TikTok cheaper to buy. “One of the main effects of the legislation would be to decrease the sale price,” said Matt Perault, director of the University of North Carolina’s Center on Technology Policy, which gets funding from TikTok and other tech companies. “As you approach that 180-day clock, the pressure on the company to sell or risk being banned entirely would be high, which would mean probably the acquirers could get it at a lower price.” The bill calls for prohibiting TikTok in the US but makes an exception if there’s a “qualified divestiture.” That could only happen if the US president determines “through an interagency process” that TikTok is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” according to the bill.  Not only that, but the new US-based TikTok would have to completely cut ties with ByteDance.  That includes no more “cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” It reflects longstanding concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.  The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. It’s an unusual bill in the way that it targets a single company.  Typically, a government group led by the Treasury secretary called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, will review whether such a sale would pose any national security threats. Yes. The Trump administration brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. The deal would have also made Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok’s US user data and securing computer systems to ensure national security requirements are satisfied.  Microsoft also made a failed bid for TikTok that its CEO Satya Nadella later described as the “strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Instead of congressional action, the 2020 arrangement was in response to then-President Donald Trump’s series of executive actions targeting TikTok. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons. Trump’s executive orders got held up in court as the 2020 presidential election loomed. China also had imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Incoming President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed course and dropped the legal proceedings. Now Biden says he’s in favor a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance won’t divest, and Trump is not."
"President Biden on Tuesday clinched the 2024 Democratic nomination for president, topping the 1,968 delegate threshold with an easy win in the Georgia primary.  Biden, 81, will be coronated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and it is virtually certain that his Republican general election opponent will be former President Donald Trump, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest.  The 81-year-old president cruised through the primary process, encountering only minimal competition by the insurgent campaigns of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and self-help guru Marianne Williamson — neither of whom obtained any delegates this cycle.  Biden, however, was dealt an embarrassing Super Tuesday loss in the Democratic caucus in American Samoa,  , winning  three delegates for the convention.  The president was also plagued in several state primaries by Democratic voters   rather than vote for the incumbent. The “uncommitted” campaign served as a protest to Biden’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas and refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire in the conflict.  “Uncommitted” has thus far racked up 20 delegates for the DNC convention.  “This is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America,” Biden told voters in a hype video released moments after he clinched the nomination. “Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to defend our freedoms? Are you ready to win this election,” he continued.  On the campaign trail, the president has accused Trump, 77, of attempting to “ , division, and darkness that defined his term in office.”  Biden has argued that his predecessor is “driven by grievance and grift,” “focused on his own revenge and retribution” and seeking to “rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.” Trump, who can clinch the Republican nomination Tuesday with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, leads Biden in several polls, including in numerous key battleground states.  A recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College found that Trump, benefitting from a boost in support from black and Hispanic voters, would handily win a rematch against Biden 48% to 43%.  The poll also showed Trump maintaining 97% of his core supporters who backed his 2020 campaign while picking up 10% of former Biden voters.  Biden has been mired in record-low approval ratings and has lost significant levels of support among key Democratic voting blocs, including blacks, Hispanics and Muslims, amid concerns over the economy,   and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  The president, the oldest man to ever serve in the Oval Office, has also been rocked by a scathing Justice Department report that raised doubts about his mental acuity.  In the report released last month, Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his decision not to charge Biden related to his retention of classified documents after the vice presidency because he would be seen by jurors as an “ .” A Trump-Biden rematch would be the first replay of a presidential general election contest since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower squared off against Adlai Stevenson."
"Donald Trump got called out online for failing to greet his 10-year-old grandson, Joseph, and instead schmoozing with “B list celebrities” at   in Miami over the weekend. “Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out,” attorney Ron Filipkowski  Tuesday alongside a video of the former president walking around the Kaseya Center. “This is who he really is behind the fake show.” However, Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, told Page Six exclusively in response to Filipkowski’s original post, “Imagine being some sad, basement dwelling internet troll who is suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has to make up some fantasy story to bring meaning to his miserable life. Sad!” Now I see what Ivanka was so pissed. Trump blew off his own grandson while he was mugging with B List celebrities and the kid was pretty bummed out. This is who he really is behind the fake show.  In the clip Filipkowski referenced, Trump — who is dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie with white stripes — is seen walking behind a group of security while waving at fans and fellow attendees. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy then stands up to shake his hand before Trump, 77, sees his daughter Ivanka Trump standing on his left-hand side. The former “Apprentice” star gives his eldest daughter a kiss and says hello to son-in-law Jared Kusher, but walks away as his grandson Joseph is walking up to greet him. Ivanka, 42, is then seen with a big smile on her face but when she turns around, Joseph appears to be staring off with a downcast look on his face.

The real estate mogul celebrated a big victory on Super Tuesday, but fans called out at the time that his wife, Melania Trump,  . The former first lady’s ex-aide then went on X earlier this week to speculate why her former pal’s marriage with Donald was on the rocks. “Chivalry for Donald was waiting for Melania to go first & ensuring she walked by his side. He’s   recently,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff wrote on Sunday. Melania, 53, has not addressed the comments and Ivanka has also not issued a statement on her father’s alleged behavior toward her son. Page Six reached out to her rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. The former first daughter was seen at UFC 299, though, watching the match alongside her dad Saturday. Aside from Joseph, Ivanka and Kushner, 43, also share a 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, and 7-year-old son, Theodore, who were not present for the mixed martial arts fight. The family moved to Miami after the mother of three   and no longer play a big role in her father’s politics."
"White House attorneys asked former special counsel Robert Hur to “revise”   before the   to not bring charges against the commander-in-chief for retention of national security material. “They did request certain edits and changes to the draft report,” Hur told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during his testimony Tuesday. The ex-special counsel was referring to a Feb. 5 letter from White House counsel Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal lawyer Bob Bauer. “We request that you revisit your descriptions of President Biden’s memory and revise them so that they are stated in a manner that is within the bounds of your expertise and remit,” the attorneys wrote. Three days later,   was released by Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the start of the hearing that the president did not “seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report” — despite repeated entreaties by his lawyers to Justice Department officials. “The report thus demonstrates President Biden’s complete devotion to the rule of law, and his respect for a fair and independent Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “President Biden did not assert executive privilege or claim absolute immunity for presidential crimes. He did not hide boxes of documents under his bed nor in a bathtub. He did not fight investigators, nor did he seek to redact a single word of Mr. Hur’s report,” he added. “He consented to the search of numerous locations, including his homes, and he did everything to cooperate, not obstruct.” Sauber wrote another letter to Garland on Feb. 7, the day before the report came out, to accuse Hur of having further “violate[d] Department of Justice policy and practice by pejoratively characterizing uncharged conduct,” according to a copy of the missive  . “The Special Counsel can certainly and properly note that the President lacked memory of a specific fact or series of events,” Sauber said. “But his report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” Jordan pointed out a third missive that Sauber and Bauer fired off to Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer on Feb. 12, which also claimed Hur had violated department policy. “We reiterate our objections to Special Counsel Hur’s inclusion of these unnecessary and unwarranted comments in the strongest possible terms,” they wrote, according to a copy of the letter also  . Hur said the   — which involved the dates of his time in office as vice president, the year his son Beau died of brain cancer, and what a fax machine is — was necessary to “show my work.” “I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” he said in his opening remarks to the committee. Biden, 81, railed against Hur’s characterization of his mental faculties the evening the report dropped, maligning him as a “Republican counsel” despite the former US attorney for Maryland being unanimously confirmed to that position in 2018. Former President Donald Trump nominated Hur as Maryland’s top federal prosecutor in February of that year, and he was confirmed the next month, with both of the state’s Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, lauding the choice. White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Fresh polling shows former   with an edge over   in the battleground state of Georgia some eight months out from their expected rematch.  Trump dispatched Biden 46% to 42%, which marks a decline from his six-point lead about a month ago, according to a poll from  . Twelve percent of voters were undecided.  Trump similarly won out 52% to Biden’s 48% among undecided voters, according to the poll.  When third-party contenders were added to the mix, the 77-year-old’s lead grew even stronger, jumping to 44% followed by Biden at 37%, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr at 5%, political activist Cornel West at 2% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 1%. “Biden voters are twice as likely to be motivated by their dislike for Trump (30%) compared to Trump voters’ motivation by their dislike for Biden (15%),” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, explained.  “A plurality of Trump voters (32%) are breaking for him due to their concern about an issue, with the economy (29%) and immigration (21%) being the top priorities for these voters.” The survey was taken from March 5 to 7 and sampled 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Trump is averaging a 6.2 percentage point lead over Biden, 81, in the   of Georgia polling.  Once seen as a reliable red state, Georgia has suddenly grown increasingly competitive, opting for Biden in 2020 and sending two Democrats to the US Senate. It marked the first time since 1992 that Georgia went blue in a presidential cycle.  The state has 16 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. It is generally considered among the top six or seven battleground states that will determine the 2024 winner. Trump erupted in fury during the aftermath of his loss in Georgia and infamously rang Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to stress the need  . That triggered an investigation from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office that culminated in a 13-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.  Throughout that process, Trump’s relationship with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp grew acrimonious. Trump backed one of Kemp’s GOP primary rivals in the 2022 midterm elections and assailed him publicly.  But Kemp hinted Tuesday that he voted for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary contest. “I voted Friday in the Republican presidential preference primary and I’ve said for a long time now I’d support the nominee,” he told reporters. “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden. It’s as simple as that,” Kemp explained when pressed about how he could vote for Trump. Kemp repeatedly   about Trump while the GOP primary contest was still alive but stopped short of endorsing any of his rivals.  Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are all set to hold their Republican presidential nominating contests Tuesday. Trump is the de facto nominee already with 1,089 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the party nod.  “I know when Secretary Raffensperger picked this day, I know he thought we might be the determining state. It ends up we’re kind of an afterthought at this point,” Kemp said.  Trump enjoys a slim 1.7 percentage point edge over Biden in national head-to-head matchup polling and when pitted against his successor in most of the key battleground states,  . "
"WASHINGTON — Former special counsel Robert Hur told lawmakers Tuesday that his report on President Biden’s alleged   “did not exonerate” Biden of wrongdoing and that the commander-in-chief and his defenders were misleading the public about key details in the case. “I did not exonerate him and that word does not appear in the report,” Hur corrected Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) during a five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Jayapal, the influential chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, spoke over Hur as he corrected her before she cut him off by saying, “Mr. Hur, it’s my time. Thank you.” Hur testified that Biden lied at least twice to the public; once when claiming he had not shared classified information with a ghostwriter and again when the president alleged that he had locked up the documents in question — and Hur also revealed that the White House counsel’s office had sought to purge his report of negative assessments of Biden’s mental fitness. Hur wrote in his bombshell report, released Feb. 8, that he had uncovered evidence that Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” but found that the 81-year-old should not face charges for hoarding the nation’s secrets over a span of decades on the grounds that jurors would likely see him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” The ex-special counsel further stated that Biden made a number of false statements about the investigation at a bellicose  following the release of the report, during which Biden, who is seeking a second term in the November election, insisted: “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) read from a transcript of the presser, when Biden defended his mental acuity and his stashing of documents at his homes and at an unlocked DC office provided by the University of Pennsylvania. “Question: ‘Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?'” Gaetz narrated. “The president: ‘I did not share classified information. I did not share it. I guarantee I did not.’ That’s not true, is it, Mr. Hur?” Gaetz asked “That is inconsistent with the findings based on the evidence in my report,” said Hur. “So it is a lie — just what regular people would say, right?” Gaetz said. “Yeah,” Hur said with a chuckle. Gaetz read another of Biden’s claims that “all of the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were locked or able to be locked” — with the congressman adding, “That wasn’t true either, was it?”  “That was inconsistent with the findings of our investigation,” Hur said again. “Another lie, people might say, right?” Gaetz went on. “Because what you put in your report was, ‘among the places Mr. Biden’s lawyers found classified documents in the garage was a damaged open box.'”

					Never miss a story.				 Shortly before the hearing, the Justice Department released  with Hur and his team on Oct. 8-9, 2023, which confirmed the special counsel’s account of Biden presenting himself as confused on multiple points. The transcripts revealed that Biden  , who died in 2015, was “deployed or is dying” after he left office in 2017. Biden mangled other facts, too, saying at one point: “If it was 2013 — when did I stop being vice president?” — he left office as vice president in 2017 — as well as: “In 2009, am I still vice president?” Some Republicans suggested that Biden may have feigned senility to avoid accountability — with Gaetz outlining his theory that Biden ducked charges by exercising a “senile co-operator” strategy, unlike 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, who faces   for allegedly mishandling records. “He just blatantly lies, and what I’m trying to figure out is whether or not Biden’s lying because he’s still so senile he hasn’t read your report, or whether it’s a little craftier and a little more devious and perhaps a little more intentional,” Gaetz said. Democrats defended Biden by pointing out that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee against Biden, is also accused of deliberately hindering National Archives attempts to retrieve classified documents — while playing clips of the 45th president also publicly misstating facts. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) exclaimed at one point that speculation about Biden’s cognition was “disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) charged that Hur had “used [his] report to trash and smear President Biden,” insinuating it was because the special prosecutor, a registered Republican, had his eye on a federal judgeship or Justice Department post in a new Trump administration. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accused Republicans of being “amateur memory specialists, giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the president of the United States whose soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous repartee with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of Union address last week.” Hur testified that although Biden acknowledged to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer after leaving office in 2017 that “I just found all of the classified stuff downstairs” at Biden’s post-vice presidential home in northern Virginia, it was Hur’s judgment that a jury would not convict Biden — though the ex-Maryland US attorney did agree with a suggestion by Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) that a “rational juror” may have backed a guilty verdict.  Hur’s findings upset both Republicans — who allege a double standard with the Trump case and noted that Zwonitzer deleted audio files of Biden after the investigation began — and Democrats, who felt the cognitive assessments harm Biden’s re-election chances.. “The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement, ‘Well, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs’ and he told us that he didn’t remember saying that to his ghostwriter,” Hur said. “He also said he didn’t remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn’t remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage.  “My assessment and the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair.”"
"This imbecile dares to apologize for calling the illegal-immigrant thug who allegedly murdered Riley “illegal” — which he is — while refusing to apologize to Riley’s family for getting her name wrong twice (“ ” Miranda Devine, March 10). Riley’s life was allegedly taken by this animal, and I apologize to all animals for putting them in the same category as him. Once again, “Hidin’ Biden” panders to his far-left backers instead of real Americans. Miranda Devine is correct. When goaded into saying Laken Riley’s name — albeit incorrectly — the Narcissist-in-Chief stated that he understood what her parents were feeling because he had lost children himself. While the loss of President Biden’s children was indeed unfortunate, his losses are hardly comparable to the brutal murder of Laken Riley — a direct result of Biden’s open invitation to third-world criminals. Biden always has to lie to make it about himself — from falsely stating for decades that his wife was hit by a drunk driver to repeatedly claiming that his son Beau was a casualty of the war in Iraq. Biden even went on to apologize for calling the alleged murderer himself an “illegal.” During his State of the Union address, President Biden used the term “illegal” instead of “undocumented” when he mentioned the suspect in Riley’s murder. He then soon apologized for calling the suspect an “illegal.” And to add insult to injury, Biden never apologized to Riley’s family for mistakenly calling her “Lincoln.” Lastly, I did not hear him mention the names of any of the 13 US soldiers who were killed when we pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden sure has his priorities all mixed up.

					Never miss a story.				 It is interesting that The Post chose to highlight that President Biden mispronounced the first name of Riley, the Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant. While it is true that this was an unfortunate mistake, you chose to ignore the main body of the speech, which was delivered with vigor and command. President Biden apologized for calling Jose Ibarra an “illegal.” Joe Biden is a coward. He never even contacted Riley’s parents after she was murdered. And he couldn’t even pronounce her name right, calling her “Lincoln.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump contacted her parents and gave his prayers and condolences to them. And to top this all off, the liberal media were criticizing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because she wore a MAGA hat and interrupted the president’s address to ask him to mention Riley’s name. Illegal, illegal, illegal. There, I said the word that truly describes the people who are entering this country illegally. President Biden’s apology for referring to this alleged murderer as “illegal” instead of “undocumented” was a slap in the face to every American. What in this world is happening to this once great country? I guess at the very least we should be thankful for Biden’s mention of “Lincoln Riley” in his State of the Union address. We are being led by a mentally unfit man who only cares about himself and not his country’s citizens. Laken Riley’s name is not difficult to pronounce, yet Biden referred to her as “Lincoln Riley” during his State of the Union address. Had Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not asked Biden to say her name, he would have probably left her name out entirely. After all, she wasn’t in the script. As Miranda Devine pointed out, Biden has no empathy when it comes to someone’s tragedy. And if he does recognize that tragedy, he brings up a misfortune of his own. He’s not capable of a real apology."
"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Tuesday that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and ex-pro wrestler and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura are among his preferred running mates. Kennedy, 70, told   that Rodgers and Ventura were “at the top of his list” to join the 2024 ticket, while two sources told the paper the men had “welcomed” the candidate’s approaches. “Yes, Mr. Kennedy did share with the New York Times that he’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a short list,” a campaign rep confirmed The Post Tuesday evening without elaborating. The Times report added that Kennedy has gauged running mate interest from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and 2020 presidential candidate and 2021 New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang — all of whom have apparently turned him down.  Rodgers, 40, was traded to the Jets before the 2023 season after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. However, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four plays into his New York tenure and missed the rest of the season. The NFL star was an early endorser of Kennedy, pushing the hashtag “kennedy2024” on social media as far back as April of last year. Just last month, Kennedy posted an image of the two hiking in an undisclosed location as Rodgers continues his recovery. Both Kennedy and Rodgers are well-known vaccine skeptics, with Rodgers becoming more outspoken on the issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rodgers has one year left on his two-year, $75 million, fully guaranteed contract, which he signed after the trade to the Jets. It is unclear how a potential vice presidential candidacy would affect his football commitments. Reps for Rodgers did not respond while the Jets declined to comment. Ventura, 72, stunned the political world in 1998 when he won Minnesota’s gubernatorial election as a member of the Reform Party, though he later switched his allegiance to the Independence Party of Minnesota and opted not to run for re-election four years later, citing his wife’s health. Kennedy told the Times Tuesday that he had kept in touch with Ventura since the former wrestler, known for his nickname “The Body,” introduced him at a campaign event in Arizona last month.  While Kennedy is considered a long shot to win the White House, political observers say he could win votes at a clip not seen by a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.  An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Kennedy getting 15% in a three-way race, with Trump getting 39.8% of the vote and President Biden getting 35.5%. The independent’s campaign claims to have made the 2024 ballot in four states: Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire and Utah — with similar efforts underway in battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina."
"A House bill requiring TikTok’s China-based owner   this week – and the wildly popular video app’s risks to national security are at the forefront of a fierce political debate about whether it should become law. TikTok’s congressional critics were given fresh fodder ahead of an expected House floor vote on Wednesday   by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that the Chinese Communist Party has used the app to influence US elections. US intelligence officials found that TikTok has played a role in “malign influence operations,” with “accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Chinese Communist Party “may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,” the report said.  “Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals.” TikTok — whose CEO Shou Chew answers to owner Beijing-based ByteDance, led by chairman Zhang Yiming — plans to put up a no-holds-barred legal fight before it even considers making a sale, which the company sees as a last resort,   on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The bill, which would give TikTok parent ByteDance six months to divest or be banned, is one of the most significant threats the app has faced and advanced past a House committee in a rare 50-0 vote last week.  The DNI report added even more urgency for lawmakers who fear TikTok is a propaganda and spying tool for Beijing. President Biden has signaled he would sign the bill if it came to his desk. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called it a “critical national security bill.” But Trump – who pushed to ban TikTok during his lone term in office – has surprised the GOP’s China hawks by stating he now opposes the measure. The 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner admitted he sees TikTok as a national security threat but argued a ban would only benefit Instagram parent Meta. “Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s reversal reportedly came after he met with billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass, whose fund holds a massive $33 billion stake in ByteDance.  , sources say Yass has been “bullying” lawmakers by threatening to withhold donations if they support the bill. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump aide, has reportedly been lobbying on TikTok’s behalf on Capitol Hill and has met with lawmakers at least 10 times in recent months,  . To be sure, not everyone House is on board with the legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)   and asserted that it contains text that would give the president “the power to ban website sites, not just apps.” This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control! If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite “foreign control” as the issue, but it does not.  Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media firm X, chimed in to agree with Massie – writing that the law was “not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not,’”  . Prominent progressive Democrats, including “Squad” members such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have previously signaled they are against a TikTok ban. The legislation also faces obstacles in the Senate.  Among the bill’s critics in the GOP is Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who said he is “absolutely opposed to it” on freedom of speech grounds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who said he is “definitely conflicted” about whether it is the right solution to concerns about TikTok. “Banning TikTok, maybe that’s necessary to protect American data from China. But if you can find a way to avoid that, that’d be good, too,” Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has yet to say whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Elsewhere, TikTok has called the bill a de facto ban and taking the aggressive step of pushing its users to raise a stink with lawmakers on its behalf. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok. If the bill is passed, TikTok is expected to by a hot target among the few large-cap firms with the resources to buy the company. , rumors have swirled that bankers are already putting together bids in the event that TikTok hits the market. Experts floated cloud-computing giant Oracle, which nearly bought TikTok when it last faced calls for a ban, as a potential suitor. Big Tech firms like Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Google were also floated as logical contenders. Ex-Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick reportedly approached ByteDance to express interest, the  ."
"Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck will resign next week, making him the third party member to leave office before the end of the 118th Congress, his office announced Tuesday. Buck, 65, said in a statement it was “an honor to serve the people of Colorado’s 4th District” for nearly five full terms, but he “will depart Congress” on March 22. “I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family,” he added, without revealing what role he would play. In an interview minutes after the news broke, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Buck whether former President Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee informed his decision. “I think our system is broken in how we choose candidates and I want to get involved in that process,” Buck told her.  “It is the worst year of the nine years and three months that I’ve been in Congress. And having talked to former members, it’s the worst year in 40 to 50 years to be in Congress.” But the Colorado congressman has also been eyeing a job at CNN as an on-air commentator,  . “Could be his CNN contract is coming in sooner than expected,” one Hill source joked. Former House Speaker   (R-Calif.) and Rep.   (R-Ohio) also resigned before the end of their congressional terms. With Buck out, House Republicans will have a 218-213 majority and three vacancies that will be filled by special elections before November. House Democrats have only one vacancy to fill after Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) resigned on Feb. 2. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis must set a date for a special election that will determine Buck’s successor no later than 90 days before the general election. A spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office told The Post that the Colorado Republican Party’s vacancy committee will choose just a nominee for the special election, which would likely be from the already-crowded primary field of five candidates. Primary races for congressional seats in Colorado are currently scheduled for May 25. Buck revealed he was retiring from office last November after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was unanimously voted in to lead the Republican conference. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a group of eight Republicans — including Buck — voted with every House Democrat to   from the speakership on Oct. 3. Buck held up several speaker nominees from winning the gavel that month, opting to vote instead for House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota on each ballot. He refused to vote for nominees who he said believed that the 2020 election was rigged — and later criticized Republicans for continuing to “rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and rely on the January 6th narrative, and the political prisoners from January 6th and other things.” “If we’re going to solve difficult problems we got to deal with some very unpleasant truths — or lies — and make sure we project to the public what the truth is,” Buck said on MSNBC when announcing his retirement. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who did not vote for McCarthy’s ouster,  , along with state Reps. Richard Holtorf and Mike Lynch, ex-radio host Deborah Flora and Logan County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. The winner of the special election will likely gain an advantage as an incumbent over their Democratic or Republican challenger in November."
"“The Harvard motto is  , Latin for truth. But, as I discovered, truth can get you fired,”  . Kulldorf backed the “Swedish approach” to COVID — no school closures and a focus on the elderly. Sweden saw the lowest excess mortality from COVID in Europe. He argued that people with prior natural infections (and kids) didn’t need vaccines, since “Covid-acquired immunity is superior to vaccine-acquired immunity.” For his views, National Institutes of Health big Francis Collins called him a “fringe” scientist and “asked his colleagues to orchestrate a ‘devastating published takedown.’ ” Kulldorf “faced a choice between science or my academic career” and “chose the former” — though “my hope is that someday, Harvard will find its way back to academic freedom and independence.” In 2020, President Biden said he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else”;  : “If something doesn’t change for Biden soon, he will be the bridge from one Trump term to another.” Why? “Biden’s bridge doesn’t connect to a healthier politics” or “carry us to a safer world.”  “Under Biden, America has behaved ambivalently as the Middle East descended into regional war and watched China, North Korea and now Haiti with worried eyes,” while “millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border, including individuals on the FBI terror watch list and hardened criminals.” “Americans doubt his capacities and say his policies have hurt not helped them,” and “if they do sense improvement in their lives, do not credit Biden for it.” In their “Day After” proposal, “Israeli leaders recognized that the key to long-term stability lies not just with demilitarizing Gaza, but with deradicalizing it into the future,”  .

Israel would “maintain security control” while addressing the culture of hate in Gaza institutions, plus closing “the United Nations Relief Works Administration, which has close ties to Hamas.” Post-war, Israel “must work with international partners to marginalize the forces that foster, fund, and incite hate.” This requires “overhauling Palestinian education systems and curricula so that they do not dehumanize Jews or call for Israel’s destruction.” Bottom line: Israel “must demilitarize and deradicalize.” “If you want a transparent, responsive government, one place to start is by demanding the creation of independent offices to resolve public records disputes outside of costly courtroom battles,”  , as an AP survey find “that fewer than a third of states have offices to handle Freedom of Information appeals and force agencies to comply with the law.” So “two Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers claimed earlier this month that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blocked the release of DeSantis’ publicly-funded travel records.”  And “in Virginia, a former Richmond government employee filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit earlier this month alleging that city officials told her to intentionally delay and stonewall Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.” Officials can keep flouting legit requests as “there is no one to hold them accountable and few consequences in the rare instances that they are scolded.” Big banks “are already too dominant,”  . “We should try to avoid making them bigger.” Federal law requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to sell failed banks to the highest bidder, and large ones have “inherent advantages in the bidding process.” But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should consider the impact on competition before approving a bank to bid. “With growing distress in commercial real estate markets, more banks are likely to fail over the next few years.” Leaving regional banks “vulnerable” while letting mega-banks “gobble up failed ones” will leave the system “more concentrated than ever.”"
" said Tuesday there is a 50-50 chance of Congress passing legislation that would provide antitrust protection and regulation to college athletics in the U.S. by the end of the year. Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his previous estimate of 60-40 from last fall of a bill getting through before the election in November, saying he and his counterparts are running out of time. “The clock is running,” Cruz said after overseeing a panel on the topic that included former Alabama coach  .  “It’s not too late to get it done, but we’re getting close to it being too late to get it done. I still think there are elements there of getting bipartisan agreement. We just have not been able to get everyone to the table to sign off.” Cruz said something will eventually get done to standardize how athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses and to give the NCAA and conferences the ability to govern college sports without the constant threat of lawsuits and state laws undercutting their authority. The gathering was not an official hearing, but going on at the same time in the House was the 12th hearing on college sports on Capitol Hill since 2020.  This one was held in front of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and was focused on the possibility of college athletes joining unions. But Cruz’s roundtable with Saban, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips and Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne stole the spotlight.  Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also attended. Moran and Blumenthal put forth a bipartisan proposal for a college sports bill last summer, but like several efforts before and after it has gone nowhere. “Mostly we would tell each other, ‘We’re just this close to getting something done,’ but it’s been going on a long time,” Moran said, pleading for stakeholders to provide feedback on what they can give and take. “This is the moment to strike. Please help us close that gap and get this done.” NCAA President   has encouraged membership to act on its own, putting forth a proposal in December that would create a new tier of Division I where schools would be required to pay some of their athletes. The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, the two wealthiest and most powerful conferences, formed a joint advisory committee earlier this year to try to tackle the issues facing college sports. Nick Saban, who led Alabama football to six national titles in 17 seasons, said the current landscape shaped by NIL funds and loosened transfer rules contributed to his decision to retire at 72. “All the things I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics,” Saban said.  “It’s whoever wants to pay the most money, raise the most money, buy the most players is going to have the best opportunity to win. And I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics, and I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.” Also taking part in the roundtable were NIL attorney Darren Heitner, Collective Association president Russell White, as well as current women’s college basketball player Haley Cavinder and sister Hanna, a former player. Other senators cycled through, offering concerns, such as   (D-W.Va.) saying he believes the status quo is “going to destroy the student-athlete as we know it.” Byrne warned that even a school as prestigious as Alabama may have to cut non-revenue-generating sports, depending on what the final answer is for paying athletes. Cruz, citing the comments made by commissioners of conferences made up of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and concerns about Division II and Division III programs shuttering, does not believe there’s as much interest in classifying college athletes as employees as there was six months ago. “There are very few people advocating for student-athletes as employees now,” Cruz said.  “I think that makes it easier when you have widespread agreement that that’s the wrong solution to have some clarity on that point.” Just last week,   to join a union and several active antitrust lawsuits are challenging NCAA compensation caps and whether athletes should have employee status. Baker said last month that Congress needed to act to protect what he described as the “95 percent” of athletes whose ability to play college sports would be endangered by a court ruling or regulatory decision declaring them as employees of their schools.  The NCAA and Power Five conferences spent a combined $2.97 million on lobbying efforts in 2023, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. Work has been ongoing for several years to figure out a solution for what Cruz called the current “Wild West” state of college athletics and the NCAA. Cruz, who last summer introduced draft legislation to tackle the problems, prefers empowering the NCAA to oversee the landscape rather than a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency. Cruz said he felt urgency to pass something sooner than later and found agreement on that point among colleagues given the current state of confusion in college sports. “Nobody really likes the direction we’re heading in right now,” Moran said.  “I think we’re close. We’re really close, and we need to get it done.”"
